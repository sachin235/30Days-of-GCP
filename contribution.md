We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

Pull Request Process

1. Make sure all build or install dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when you run a build.
2. Update README.md with details of the interface changes, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in all the sample files and the README.md file to the new version that this pull request would represent.
4. You can merge the pull request once you have approval from two other developers, or if you don&#39;t have permission to do so, you can ask the second reviewer to merge it for you.

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code:

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

1. A quick summary and/or background
2. Being specified about it.
3. What you expected would happen
4. What actually happens
5. Notes
