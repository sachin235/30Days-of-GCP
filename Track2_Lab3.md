## Create a Datastudio report

- Enter the following code in the BigQuery editor and Run:
```
SELECT
  date, SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS country_cases,
  SUM(cumulative_deceased) AS country_deaths
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE
  date BETWEEN '2020-03-15'
  AND '2020-04-30'
  AND country_name ="United States of America"
GROUP BY date
```
- Click On EXPLORE DATA > Explore with Data Studio.
- Authorize your BigQuery in Data Studio
- You may fail to create a report for the first-time logon of Data Studio. Click + Blank Report and accept the Terms of Service. Go back to the BigQuery page and click Explore with Data Studio again.
- In the new Data Studio report, select Add a chart > Time series Chart.
- Add country_cases and country_deaths to the Metric field.
- Click Save to commit the change.

##### If anyhow you fail to get score of this task, remove all data and reports from the Datastudio console before retry.
