[30 Days of Google Cloud program](<(https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/)>) will provide you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands-on practice on Google Cloud Platform - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Along the way, you will learn & practice concepts like computing, application development, big data & machine learning using cloud & if you get stuck, you will have your "Campus Facilitators" who are specially trained on Google Cloud to help. 😎

### Why should I enrol in the program?

There are a lot of things in store for you.

1. You can showcase what you've learned here to your professional network **using Google Cloud-hosted quest & skill badges** that you can add to your resume and professional profiles like LinkedIn. 🏆

2. And on top of these amazing badges, get a chance to **win some really cool Google Cloud goodies**. 💪 [(See Prize Rules section)](https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/prize-rules/)

### Tracks/Program's Syllabus

The program will introduce you to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Google Cloud Skills Boost where you will learn each of these topic using self-paced labs that provides you temporary credentials to Google Cloud, so you can learn the cloud using the real thing – no simulations.

For convinience, we have divided the topics above into 2 different tracks - [Cloud Engineering Track and Data Science & Machine Learning Track.](https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/program-syllabus/#content)
