GCP will provide you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands-on practice on Google Cloud Platform - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

  

Along the way, you will learn & practice concepts like computing, application development, big data & machine learning using cloud & if you get stuck, you will have your "Campus Facilitators" who are specially trained on Google Cloud to help. ðŸ˜Ž

  

### Tracks/Program's Syllabus

  

The program will introduce you to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Google Cloud Skills Boost where you will learn each of these topic using self-paced labs that provides you temporary credentials to Google Cloud, so you can learn the cloud using the real thing â€“ no simulations.

  

For convinience, we have divided the topics above into 2 different tracks - [Cloud Engineering Track and Data Science & Machine Learning Track.](https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/program-syllabus/#content)
